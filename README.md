### Exercise 1 contains both the tutorial packages and own packages, plots and screenshot of the WiFi config



### Exercise 2  Visualisation tool using Python2.4 and Tkinter along with a screenshot of the tool. 
##### Note its not live plot. Could not manage to do real time and few other small features requested. However this is an another [LIVE tool](https://github.com/bsridatta/twittericon) I made earlier to visualise sentiments of realtime tweets using twitter API. I plots in realtime based on the tweets.
